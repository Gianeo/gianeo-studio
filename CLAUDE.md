# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Gianni Favaretto, a design leader and product strategist. The site showcases work experience, services, client logos, and design philosophy.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15.3.2 with App Router
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 (with CSS @theme inline configuration)
- Storybook 9.1 for component development
- Lenis for smooth scrolling

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start Next.js dev server with Turbopack

# Build & Production
npm run build           # Build for production
npm start               # Start production server

# Code Quality
npm run lint            # Run ESLint

# Storybook
npm run storybook       # Start Storybook dev server on port 6006
npm run build-storybook # Build Storybook static site
```

## Architecture & Code Organization

### App Structure
- **App Router**: Uses Next.js 15 App Router with file-based routing in `src/app/`
- **Layout Pattern**: Root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) contains comprehensive SEO metadata, structured data (JSON-LD), and font configuration
- **Main Page**: `src/app/page.tsx` composes all sections with semantic HTML and ARIA labels

### Component Architecture

**Section Components** (`src/components/sections/`)
- Self-contained page sections: Hero, ClientsLogos, ProductShowcase, Profile, Services, WorkHistory
- Each section is a default export from its index file
- Data for sections stored in co-located `data.ts` files when needed

**UI Components** (`src/components/ui/`)
- Reusable UI primitives built on Radix UI primitives
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns with Tailwind styling
- Each component has corresponding `.stories.tsx` file for Storybook
- Use the `cn()` utility from `src/lib/utils.ts` for conditional class merging

**Layout Components** (`src/components/layout/`)
- `SmoothScrollLayout.tsx`: Lenis smooth scroll implementation with context provider
- Exports `ScrollContext` and `useScroll()` hook for programmatic scrolling

### Styling System

**Tailwind CSS v4**
- Configuration in `src/app/globals.css` using `@theme inline` directive
- Design tokens defined as CSS custom properties (e.g., `--radius`, `--background`)
- Dark mode using class-based variant: `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *))`
- Uses OKLCH color space for better color accuracy

**Typography**
- Fonts loaded via Next.js `localFont()` in `src/lib/fonts.ts`
- **Switzer**: Body copy and headings (weights: 400, 500, 600, 700)
- **Azeret Mono**: Monospace text (weight: 300)
- Applied via CSS variables: `--font-copy`, `--font-heading`, `--font-mono`
- Usage: `font-copy`, `font-heading`, `font-mono` Tailwind classes

**Animations**
- Uses `tw-animate-css` package for utility-based animations
- Custom animations available: `animate-fade-in`, `animate-slide-up`, `animate-scale-in`

### Key Patterns

**Smooth Scrolling**
- Lenis is initialized in `SmoothScrollLayout` component
- Access via `useScroll()` hook to call `scrollToSection(target)`
- Navigation component should use this for anchor links

**SEO & Metadata**
- Comprehensive metadata in `src/app/layout.tsx` including OpenGraph, Twitter Card, structured data
- Page-specific metadata exported from individual pages
- Replace placeholder values: Google Analytics ID, verification codes, domain URL

**Accessibility**
- Skip-to-content link in root layout
- Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- ARIA labels and roles on sections
- Screen reader-only headings using `sr-only` class

**Icon System**
- Primary: Phosphor Icons via `phosphor-react` package
- Alternative: Lucide React icons available
- Usage: Import and render as React components

## Component Development with Storybook

- Stories are co-located with components in `src/components/ui/`
- Storybook configured for Next.js with Vite bundler
- Addons enabled: a11y, docs, vitest
- Static assets served from `public/` directory

## Important Notes

- **Font Files**: Located in `public/fonts/` - do not move or rename
- **Dark Mode**: Applied via `dark` class on `<html>` element
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with standard Tailwind breakpoints
- **Images**: Work-related images in `public/images/work/`, client logos in `public/images/logos/clients/`
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration - ensure all components are properly typed

## Current State

The git status shows uncommitted changes to multiple files including images, components, and configuration. The site appears to be in active development with recent improvements to Storybook integration and component stories.
